## Abstract:
`Faded Philosophy` is an application for people who get intoxicated and learn the secrets of the universe. The application provides pairings of philosophers, marijuana strains, and spirits by utilizing IBM Watson's tone analyzer, for the improvement or creation of their experience. The user has the ability to create their experience through a series of dropdowns, or they may just tell the app what they are feeling. After their tone is analyzed, pairing appears on the UI. Faded Philosophy is the Mod 3 solo project at the Turing School of Software Development. The solo project seeks to test our understanding of fundamental React principles, and our use of React Router, RTL, and Jest.
